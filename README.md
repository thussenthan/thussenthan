# Hi there, I'm Thussenthan Walter-Angelo! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a passionate computer science researcher and software developer with a focus on DNA sequencing and RNA transcriptomics in the field of computational biology. With hands-on experience operating Oxford Nanopore Technologies machines and analyzing their data, Iâ€™m dedicated to advancing my expertise in the field. I hold a major in Molecular Biology with minors in Computer Science and Neuroscience from Princeton University (Class of 2024), and I enjoy applying my background and keen interests in machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analysis, web development, automation, and neural networks to solve real-world challenges. I love to explore new technologies and continuously improve my skills.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on **ML model development** (specifically recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **bioinformatics**.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **computational genomics, machine learning, AI, and neural networks**.

- **Frameworks and Libraries:** TensorFlow, along with various bioinformatics and machine learning libraries.
- **Tools and Technologies:** Git, Docker, AWS, Google Cloud, and more.
- **Research & Development:** DNA sequencing, RNA transcriptomics, computational genomics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and neural networks.

## Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on:

1. **[NLP](https://github.com/thussenthan/NLP)**: An enhanced benchmark for evaluating citation quality in LLM-generated text, building on the ALCE framework (for the COS484 course at Princeton).
2. **[Senior Thesis](https://github.com/thussenthan/Senior-Thesis_2024)**: A computational study investigating how modulating noradrenergic input affects eyeblink conditioning performance through advanced data processing and statistical analysis for my Princeton University Senior Thesis.
3. **[Freezerworks Processor](https://github.com/thussenthan/Freezerworks-Processor)**: A Python-based GUI application that automates lab processes, including sample processing, cell freezing, and aliquot assignments in the Freezerworks system, made for the Sholler Lab at the Penn State College of Medicine.
