## About Me

I am a passionate computer science researcher and software developer with a focus on DNA sequencing and RNA transcriptomics in computational biology. With hands-on experience operating Oxford Nanopore Technologies machines and analyzing the raw data output, Iâ€™m dedicated to advancing my expertise in the field. I majored in Molecular Biology with minors in Computer Science and Neuroscience from Princeton University (Class of 2024). Furthermore, I enjoy applying my background and keen interests in machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), data analysis, web development, automation, and developing better neural networks to solve real-world challenges. I love to explore new technologies and continuously improve my skills.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on **ML model development** (specifically recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **bioinformatics, DNA/RNA sequencing, and pathway analysis (IPA)**.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **computational genomics, ML/AI, and neural networks**.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **t.walterangelo@gmail.com** or at **+1 (717) 743-2777**.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was born in **Jaffna, Sri Lanka**.

## Skills

- **Languages:** Python, Java, R, C#, HTML/CSS, and more.
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, along with various bioinformatics and ML libraries.
- **Tools and Technologies:** Git, Docker/Singularity containerization, Google Cloud, AWS, HPC clusters, and more.
- **Research & Development:** DNA sequencing, RNA transcriptomics, computational genomics, ML/AI, and neural networks model development.

## Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on:

1. **[Be Confident! Enhancing ALCE Citation Evaluation in LLMs](https://github.com/thussenthan/NLP)**: Developed an enhanced benchmark model for evaluating citation quality in LLM-generated text and improved LLM citation integrity using novel intrinsic confidence metrics (Relevance, Quality, Correctness) over traditional extrinsic metrics (F1 Score, ROUGE-L), building on the ALCE framework using Python, PyTorch, OpenAI API, HuggingFace, etc. (for the COS484 (NLP) course at Princeton).
2. **[Senior Thesis](https://github.com/thussenthan/Senior-Thesis_2024)**: A computational study investigating how modulating noradrenergic input affects eyeblink conditioning performance through advanced data processing and statistical analysis for my Princeton University Senior Thesis.
3. **[Freezerworks Processor](https://github.com/thussenthan/Freezerworks-Processor)**: A Python-based GUI application that automates lab processes, including sample processing, cell freezing, and aliquot assignments in the Freezerworks system using REST API commands, made for the Sholler Lab at the Penn State College of Medicine.
